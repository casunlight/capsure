      Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy Meetings, or <a href='https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath/Get%20Involved/How%20CAPS%20works/Beat%20Meetings'>CAPS Meetings</a>, are recurring events with the <a href='http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cpd.html'>Chicago Police Department</a> and Chicago residents. 
    %p 
      The goal of CAPS is to blend traditional policing strategies with alternative strategies aimed at encouraging community members and police to work together to reduce the occurrence of crimes.
