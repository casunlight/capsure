    %p
      This site lets you find out <strong>when</strong> and <strong>where</strong> your next CAPS meeting is, in an effort to increase the level of citizen participation to make our city safer.
    
    %h4#what-are-caps-meetings What are CAPS Meetings?

    %p 
      Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy Meetings, or <a href='https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath/Get%20Involved/How%20CAPS%20works/Beat%20Meetings'>CAPS Meetings</a>, are recurring events with the <a href='http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cpd.html'>Chicago Police Department</a> and Chicago residents. 
    %p 
      The goal of CAPS is to blend traditional policing strategies with alternative strategies aimed at encouraging community members and police to work together to reduce the occurrence of crimes.

    %h4#why-did-you-build-this Why did you build this?

    %p
      When I first started attending <a href='http://www.meetup.com/OpenGovChicago/'>OpenGov Chicago(-land)</a> meetings in the Summer of 2010, improving the transparency of where, when and what was happening at CAPS meetings was a <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/opengovchicago/May$20Meeting$20Recap/opengovchicago/S9_9_KShJJc/szuzjEtTcKkJ'>frequently ocurring topic</a>. 

    %p
      Now, with the creation of the Chicago Police Department's <a href='http://api1.chicagopolice.org/clearpath/'>ClearPath API</a>, all of this CAPS meeting data is now available in a machine readable format by anyone.

    %p
      This website is a demonstration of the power of that open data. A group of developers spent a couple of days making an app, and we're one step further along the path that many others passionately set in motion.

    %h4#team Team and credits
    %p
      This is an
      %a{:href => 'http://opencityapps.org'} Open City
